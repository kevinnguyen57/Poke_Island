## Description
Developed an application of my favorite childhood game, Pokemon! The game is called Poke Island because it is inspired by Pokemon (Poke), and the map setting is on an island so Poke + Island.
Users will play as a character who can move around the map to explore, and battle with their monsters in the darker grass. Although, it is not a full length game that has a storyline like Pokemon,
it still has similar techniques and style that makes it a functional game to get a deeper perspective on how 2D Pokemon games were programmed.

I used Chris Courses to assist in making this game so if this seems familiar, IT IS! Some differences I made was mainly making my own map and character spawn location.
If you want to make a game, but don't know where to start -> Chris Courses has many games you can check out on his website: https://chriscourses.com/courses

Softwares Used:
- Tileset: To create a map to export
- Sublime Text (IDE): Where I programmed the application

Languages Used:
- HTML
- JavaScript
- There are some CSS Styling, but it is embedded in the HTML file
