## Description
Developed an application of my favorite childhood game, Pokemon! The game is called Poke Island because it is inspired by Pokemon (Poke), and the map setting is on an island so Poke + Island.
Users will play as a character who can move around the map to explore, and battle with their monsters in the darker grass. Although, it is not a full length game that has a storyline like Pokemon,
it still has similar techniques and style that makes it a functional game to get a deeper perspective on how 2D Pokemon games were programmed.

I used Chris Courses to assist in making this game so if this seems familiar, IT IS! Some differences I made was mainly making my own map and character spawn location.
If you want to make a game, but don't know where to start -> Chris Courses has many games you can check out on his website: https://chriscourses.com/courses

Softwares Used:
- Tileset: To create a map to export
- Sublime Text (IDE): Where I programmed the application

Languages Used:
- HTML
- JavaScript
- There are some CSS Styling, but it is embedded in the HTML file

## Instructions to Run the Game
If you want to try running the game, follow these instructions:
1. Download the main branch as a ZIP, you can do this by going to "<> Code" (green button) at the top right of the repository -> then click on "Download ZIP"
2. Unzip the folder and open the folder. You should see the pokemon-game folder and the README.md
3. Click inside of the pokemon-game folder and find index.html (don't click on it)
4. You can right click on the index.html file, and open as a web browser (preferably Google Chrome), or you can drag the index.html file onto a web browser as well

The game should now be up and running! Have fun!

## Instructions on how to Play
Player Movement:
- 'w' key: move up
- 'a' key: move left
- 's' key: move down

Enterting Battle Sequence:
- Find dark patches of grass and run around in it
- There is a slight chance of running into a battle

How to Battle:
- Players are given two movesets, Tackle and Fireball (you can choose either or)
- The goal is to cause the wild monster to faint by lowering it's health to 0 before your monster does
- Once one of the monsters faint, the battle ends, and the player is taken back to the map interface to continue exploring
